macro:->We
use
the
model
estimate
from
the
midpoint
year,
rather
than
the
value
at
the
first
wave,
because
this
is
the
best
measure
of
``baseline''
available
under
the
assumption
that
the
person
does
not
change.
The
first

measure
alone
contains
an
unknown
amount
of
measurement
error
and
transient

macro:->A
small
number
of
respondents
report
different
highest
degrees
at
wave
1,
wave
2,
and
wave
3.
Some
of
this
is
due
to
measurement
error,
and
some
of
it
is
due
to
a
small
number
of
people
obtaining
a
higher
degree
during
the
four
years
of
the
panel.
Estimating
the
panel
with
highest
at
wave
1
or
highest
degree
reported
across
the
panel
produces
functionally
identical
results.
