macro:->We
use
the
midpoint
estimate,
rather
than
the
value
at
the
first
wave,
because
this
is
the
best
measure
of
``baseline''
available
under
the
assumption
that
the
person
does
not
change.
The
first
wave
measure
alone
contains
an
unknown
amount
of
measurement
error
and
transient

does
not
mean
that
other
factors

not
explain
additional
variance
if
they
were
included
in

For

peoples'
responses
about
religious
beliefs
and
participation
might
systematically
vary
by
the
day
of
the
week

month
in

This

moved

of

macro:->A
small
number
of
respondents
report
different
highest
degrees
at
wave
1,
wave
2,
and
wave
3.
Some
of
this
is
due
to
measurement
error,
and
some
of
it
is
due
to
a
small
number
of
people
obtaining
a
higher
degree
during
the
four
years
of
the
panel.
Estimating
the
panel
with
highest
at
wave
1
or
highest
degree
reported
across
the
panel
produces
functionally
identical
results.
